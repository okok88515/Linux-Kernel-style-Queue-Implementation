# Seven Rules for a Great Git Commit Message:
# 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# 3. Capitalize the subject line
# 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
# 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
# 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#
# You may modify this commit message.
# To abort this commit, exit the editor without saving.
